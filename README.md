#### Biggest Win

Our initial check in was a welcome high point. Having missed several personal deadlines in the days leading up to the check in we scrambled the night before only to receive positive feedback from our instructors. Initial design, completed exclusively by Aidan, was ahead of schedule and well executed. Feeling behind and finding we were ahead of schedule was a confidence boost.

#### Biggest Struggle

Perhaps being lulled into a sense of security, we did not apply ourselves to the project over the course of the next three days. Communication was our weakest point and it showed, as we miscommunicated over what was being accomplished and found ourselves with a shanty town of a project the day before it was due. Both of us failed to uphold out end of our DTR document as multiple deadlines went unmet. We did a poor job of collaborating, leaving entire segments to the other party. Despite the mantra of "learning together" our lack of communication prevented us from helping each other.

#### Assignment
